## Project Overview
This project demonstrates the deployment of a Node.js web application on AWS EC2 with Docker and a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub jenkins. The app updates automatically with every push to GitHub.

## Steps Completed
1. **Node.js App** – Created a simple HTTP server and tested locally.  
2. **GitHub** – Version-controlled and pushed the project to GitHub.  
3. **AWS EC2** – Launched an instance, configured security groups, installed Node.js, Git, and Docker.  
4. **Server Deployment** – Cloned the repo and ran the app on EC2 public IP.  
5. **Dockerization** – Built a Docker image and ran the container for consistent deployment.  
6. **CI/CD Pipeline** – Configured GitHub Actions to automate deployment on code push.  
7. **Troubleshooting & Documentation** – Resolved workflow YAML errors, Docker image issues, and container status problems; documented the full process.
8. added a jenkins to the file easy automation
